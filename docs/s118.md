# Reagarding `calldata` && `memory`


| Aspect           | `calldata`                               | `memory`                                 | `storage`                                  |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Location**     | External input data (read-only)          | Temporary memory during function execution | Persistent contract state                   |
| **Mutability**   | ❌ Read-only                             | ✅ Read & write                          | ✅ Read & write                              |
| **Gas usage**    | ✅ Most efficient                        | ❌ Medium cost                           | ❌ Most expensive                            |
| **Lifetime**     | Function call duration only              | Function call duration only              | Persists across function calls & transactions |
| **Usage**        | Function parameters (external)           | Temporary variables in functions         | Permanent variables in contract             |
| **Modification** | ❌ Cannot modify                         | ✅ Can modify                            | ✅ Can modify                                |
| **Persistence**  | ❌ Not saved                             | ❌ Not saved                             | ✅ Saved to blockchain                       |
| **Best for**     | Passing large read-only inputs           | Short-term processing data               | Contract state that must be stored          |

# General Notes 

1. Note in your main contract, both get messages are storing to same variale
2. Variables that are marked public , will have a function made automatically by the EVM

3. Look at this code 

```solidity 
  string public bootyMessage; // even though nothing set function is automatically made
    string public pussyMessage; // even though nothing set function is automatically made

    constructor() {
    bootyMessage = "BootyLickers";
    pussyMessage = "Pussy Smellers";
    }
```
- Even though your set the variables via `string` evm will automatically assing functions to it. But to use it 
- You need to call the initial constructor to set the message
